```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

st.title('Uber pickups in NYC')
DATE_COLUMN = 'date/time'
DATA_URL = ('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/'
         'streamlit-demo-data/uber-raw-data-sep14.csv.gz')

def load_data(nrows):
    data = pd.read_csv(DATA_URL, nrows=nrows)
    data[DATE_COLUMN] = pd.to_datetime(data[DATE_COLUMN])
    return data

data = load_data(10000)
```
Create a bar chart
```python
hist_values = np.histogram(
    data[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour, bins=24, range=(0,24)
)[0]

st.bar_chart(hist_values)
```
Plot data on a map with sliding filter
```python
hour_to_filter = st.slider('hour', 0, 23, 17)  # min: 0h, max: 23h, default: 17h
filtered_data = data[data[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour == hour_to_filter]

st.subheader(f'Map of all pickups at {hour_to_filter}:00')

st.map(filtered_data)
```
